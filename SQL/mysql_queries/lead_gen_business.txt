1. What query would you run to get the total revenue for March of 2012?

SELECT SUM(amount) AS revenue FROM billing
WHERE charged_datetime LIKE '2012-03%'

2. What query would you run to get total revenue collected from the client with an id of 2?

SELECT client_id, SUM(amount) as total_revenue FROM billing
WHERE client_id = 2

3. What query would you run to get all the sites that client=10 owns?

SELECT domain_name as website, client_id FROM sites
WHERE client_id = 10

4. What query would you run to get total # of sites created per month per year for the client with an id of 1? What about for client=20?

SELECT client_id, COUNT(domain_name) AS number_of_websites, MONTHNAME(created_datetime) AS month, YEAR(created_datetime) as YEAR FROM sites
WHERE client_id = 1
GROUP BY site_id

SELECT client_id, COUNT(domain_name) AS number_of_websites, MONTHNAME(created_datetime) AS month, YEAR(created_datetime) as YEAR FROM sites
WHERE client_id = 20
GROUP BY site_id

5. What query would you run to get the total # of leads generated for each of the sites between January 1, 2011 to February 15, 2011?

SELECT sites.domain_name AS website, COUNT(leads.leads_id), DATE(leads.registered_datetime) AS created_date
FROM leads
JOIN sites ON sites.site_id = leads.site_id
WHERE DATE(leads.registered_datetime) BETWEEN "2011-01-01" and "2011-02-15"
GROUP BY leads.site_id, leads.registered_datetime

6. What query would you run to get a list of client names and the total # of leads we've generated for each of our clients between January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011?

SELECT CONCAT(clients.first_name, ' ',clients.last_name) AS client_name,
COUNT(leads.leads_id)
FROM clients
JOIN sites ON sites.client_id = clients.client_id
JOIN leads ON leads.site_id = sites.site_id
WHERE DATE(leads.registered_datetime) BETWEEN "2011-01-01" and "2011-12-31"
GROUP BY CONCAT(clients.first_name, ' ',clients.last_name)

7. What query would you run to get a list of client names and the total # of leads we've generated for each client each month between months 1 - 6 of Year 2011?

SELECT CONCAT(clients.first_name, ' ',clients.last_name) AS client_name,
COUNT(leads.leads_id),
MONTHNAME(leads.registered_datetime) AS month_generated
FROM clients
JOIN sites ON clients.client_id = sites.client_id
JOIN leads ON leads.site_id = sites.site_id
WHERE DATE(leads.registered_datetime) BETWEEN "2011-01-01" and "2011-06-30"
GROUP BY CONCAT(clients.first_name, ' ',clients.last_name), leads.registered_datetime

8. What query would you run to get a list of client names and the total # of leads we've generated for each of our clients' sites between January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011? Order this query by client id.

SET sql_mode=(SELECT REPLACE(@@sql_mode,'ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY',''));

SELECT CONCAT(clients.first_name, ' ',clients.last_name) AS client_name,
sites.domain_name, leads.registered_datetime,
COUNT(leads.leads_id)
FROM clients
JOIN sites ON clients.client_id = sites.client_id
JOIN leads ON leads.site_id = sites.site_id
WHERE leads.registered_datetime LIKE "2011%"
GROUP BY sites.domain_name
ORDER BY clients.client_id

Come up with a second query that shows all the clients, the site name(s), and the total number of leads generated from each site for all time.

SELECT CONCAT(clients.first_name, ' ',clients.last_name) AS client_name,
sites.domain_name, leads.registered_datetime,
COUNT(leads.leads_id)
FROM clients
JOIN sites ON clients.client_id = sites.client_id
JOIN leads ON leads.site_id = sites.site_id
GROUP BY sites.domain_name
ORDER BY clients.client_id


9. Write a single query that retrieves total revenue collected from each client for each month of the year. Order it by client id.

SELECT billing.client_id,
CONCAT(clients.first_name, ' ', clients.last_name) AS client_name,
SUM(amount) AS total_revenue,
MONTHNAME(charged_datetime) AS month, YEAR(charged_datetime) as YEAR
FROM billing
JOIN clients ON clients.client_id = billing.client_id
GROUP BY CONCAT(clients.first_name, ' ', clients.last_name), MONTH(charged_datetime), YEAR(charged_datetime)
ORDER BY billing.client_id

10. Write a single query that retrieves all the sites that each client owns. Group the results so that each row shows a new client. It will become clearer when you add a new field called 'sites' that has all the sites that the client owns. (HINT: use GROUP_CONCAT)

SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) as client_name,
GROUP_CONCAT(sites.domain_name SEPARATOR ' / ') as sites FROM clients
JOIN sites ON sites.client_id = clients.client_id
GROUP BY CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name)
ORDER BY clients.client_id
